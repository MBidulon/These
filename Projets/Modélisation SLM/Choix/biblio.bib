  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} This paper presents an investigation into residual stresses in selective laser sintering (SLS) and selective laser melting (SLM), aiming at a better understanding of this phenomenon.Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} First, the origin of residual stresses is explored and a simple theoretical model is developed to predict residual stress distributions. Next, experimental methods are used to measure the residual stress profiles in a set of test samples produced with different process parameters.Findings \textendash{} Residual stresses are found to be very large in SLM parts. In general, the residual stress profile consists of two zones of large tensile stresses at the top and bottom of the part, and a large zone of intermediate compressive stress in between. The most important parameters determining the magnitude and shape of the residual stress profiles are the material properties, the sample and substrate height, the laser scanning strategy and the heating conditions.Research limitations/implications \textendash{} All exper...},

  abstract = {Simulating the transient temperature field in additive layer manufacturing (ALM) processes has presented a challenge to many researchers in the field. The transient temperature history is vital for determining the thermal stress distribution and residual stress states in ALM-processed parts that utilise a moving laser heat source. The modelling of the problem involving multiple layers is equally of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. This paper uses an innovative simulation technique known as element birth and death, in modelling the three-dimensional temperature field in multiple layers in a powder bed. The results indicate that the heated regions undergo rapid thermal cycles that could be associated with commensurate thermal stress cycles. Deposition of successive layers and subsequent laser scanning produces temperature spikes in previous layers. The resultant effect is a steady temperature build-up in the lower layers as the number of layers increases.},

  title = {Taking into Account Thermal Residual Stresses in Topology Optimization of Structures Built by Additive Manufacturing},
  abstract = {We introduce a model and several constraints for shape and topology optimization of structures, built by additive manufacturing techniques. The goal of these constraints is to take into account the thermal residual stresses or the thermal deformations, generated by processes like Selective Laser Melting, right from the beginning of the structural design optimization. In other words, the structure is optimized concurrently for its final use and for its behavior during the layer by layer production process. It is well known that metallic additive manufacturing generates very high temperatures and heat fluxes, which in turn yield thermal deformations that may prevent the coating of a new powder layer, or thermal residual stresses that may hinder the mechanical properties of the final design. Our proposed constraints are targeted to avoid these undesired effects. Shape derivatives are computed by an adjoint method and are incorporated into a level set numerical optimization algorithm. Several 2-d and 3-d numerical examples demonstrate the interest and effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {In laser assisted additive manufacturing (AM) an accurate estimation of residual stresses and distortion is necessary to achieve dimensional accuracy and prevent premature fatigue failure, delamination and buckling of components. Since many process variables affect AM, experimental measurements of residual stresses and distortion are time consuming and expensive. Numerical thermo-mechanical models can be used for their estimation, but the quality of calculations depends critically on the accurate transient temperature field which affects both the residual stresses and distortion. In this study, a well-tested, three-dimensional, transient heat transfer and fluid flow model is used to accurately calculate transient temperature field for the residual stress and distortion modeling. The calculated residual stress distributions are compared with independent experimental results. It is shown that the residual stresses can be significantly minimized by reducing the layer thickness during AM. Inconel 718 components are found to be more susceptible to delamination than Ti-6Al-4V parts because they encounter higher residual stresses compared to their yield strength.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D printing, is a direct digital manufacturing process, where a component can be produced layer by layer from 3D digital data with no or minimal use of machining, molding, or casting. AM has developed rapidly in the last 10 years and has demonstrated significant potential in cost reduction of performance-critical components. This can be realized through improved design freedom, reduced material waste, and reduced post processing steps. Modeling AM processes not only provides important insight in competing physical phenomena that lead to final material properties and product quality but also provides the means to exploit the design space towards functional products and materials. The length- and timescales required to model AM processes and to predict the final workpiece characteristics are very challenging. Models must span length scales resolving powder particle diameters, the build chamber dimensions, and several hundreds or thousands of meters of heat source trajectories. Depending on the scan speed, the heat source interaction time with feedstock can be as short as a few microseconds, whereas the build time can span several hours or days depending on the size of the workpiece and the AM process used. Models also have to deal with multiple physical aspects such as heat transfer and phase changes as well as the evolution of the material properties and residual stresses throughout the build time. The modeling task is therefore a multi-scale, multi-physics endeavor calling for a complex interaction of multiple algorithms. This paper discusses models required to span the scope of AM processes with a particular focus towards predicting as-built material characteristics and residual stresses of the final build. Verification and validation examples are presented, the over-spanning goal is to provide an overview of currently available modeling tools and how they can contribute to maturing additive manufacturing.},
