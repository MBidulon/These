  abstract = {. A fundamental problem of manufacturing is to produce mechanical parts from billets by clearing areas within specified boundaries from the material. Based on a graph-theoretical formulation, the algorithmic handling of one particular machining problem\textemdash``zigzag pocket machining''\textemdash{}is investigated. We present a linear-time algorithm that ensures that every region of the pocket is machined exactly once, while attempting to minimize the number of tool retractions required. This problem is shown to be NP\{$\backslash$cal N$\backslash$cal P\} -hard for pockets with holes. Our algorithm is provably good in the sense that the machining path generated for a pocket with h holes requires at most 5 . . . OPT + 6 . . . h retractions, where OPT is the (unknown) minimum number of retractions required by any algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented, and practical tests for pockets without holes suggest that one can expect an approximation factor of about 1.5 for practical examples, rather than the factor 5 as proved by our analysis.},

  abstract = {In this study, we propose a tool-path generation approach for material extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) that considers the machining efficiency and fabrication precision, which are inherent drawbacks of general AM techniques compared with conventional manufacturing methods. The proposed approach aims to tackle the generation of direction-parallel tool-paths for the interior filling of simple connected areas, which comprises three main steps: (1) determining the inclination of reference lines; (2) generating and grouping tool-path segments into individual sub-paths; and (3) linking sub-paths based on specific requirements. These three modules interact to affect the efficiency and precision of AM significantly. In order to find an optimal inclination, we first analyze the impacts on the fabrication efficiency and manufacturing accuracy with different inclinations. A comparatively accurate building time model is developed subsequently to obtain the optimal tool-path inclination, but without compromising the machining precision, based on the analysis of a geometrical accuracy model. The proposed approach employs different inclinations in distinct layers according to specific manufacturing scenarios and technological requirements. After determining the reference lines, the tool-path segments are selected and grouped based on some characteristics (e.g., the number of intersections between reference lines and boundaries) to make up individual sub-paths, which are then connected to a zigzag-shaped path with short line segment connections. In the module for sub-path linking, some strategies are introduced to decrease the number of useless tool-paths, i.e., uncut paths, which could jeopardize the manufacturing quality by frequently turning the print head on and off. In addition, parametric curves are used to link the final sub-paths to avoid deceleration/acceleration processes in the end/starting parts of the sub-paths. The proposed approach has been used in practice to generate tool-paths for a wide range of models and the results verify its effectiveness and obvious advantages.},

Generally, the calculated toolpath has to minimize the machining time and respect a maximal effort on the tool during machining. Using this point of view, the toolpath can be considered as the result of an optimization in which the objective is to minimize the travel time and the constraints are to check the forces applied to the tool. Thus a method based on this account and using an optimization algorithm is proposed to compute toolpaths for pocket milling. After a review of pocketing toolpath computation methods, the framework of the optimization problem is defined. A modeling of the problem is then proposed and a solving method is presented. Finally, applications and experiments on machine tools are studied to illustrate the advantages of this method.},

This morphing leads to substantial reductions of tool wear in cutting hard metals and of machining time in cutting all metals, as experiments described here show.

The transient temperature history is vital for determining the thermal stress distribution and residual stress states in ALM-processed parts that utilise a moving laser heat source. The modelling of the problem involving multiple layers is equally of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. This paper uses an innovative simulation technique known as element birth and death, in modelling the three-dimensional temperature field in multiple layers in a powder bed. The results indicate that the heated regions undergo rapid thermal cycles that could be associated with commensurate thermal stress cycles. Deposition of successive layers and subsequent laser scanning produces temperature spikes in previous layers. The resultant effect is a steady temperature build-up in the lower layers as the number of layers increases.},

The goal of these constraints is to take into account the thermal residual stresses or the thermal deformations, generated by processes like Selective Laser Melting, right from the beginning of the structural design optimization. In other words, the structure is optimized concurrently for its final use and for its behavior during the layer by layer production process. It is well known that metallic additive manufacturing generates very high temperatures and heat fluxes, which in turn yield thermal deformations that may prevent the coating of a new powder layer, or thermal residual stresses that may hinder the mechanical properties of the final design. Our proposed constraints are targeted to avoid these undesired effects. Shape derivatives are computed by an adjoint method and are incorporated into a level set numerical optimization algorithm. Several 2-d and 3-d numerical examples demonstrate the interest and effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology to generate deposition paths for wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The medial axis transformation (MAT), which represents the skeleton of a given geometry, is firstly extracted to understand the geometry. Then a deposition path that is based on the MAT is efficiently generated. The resulting MAT-based path is able to entirely fill any given cross-sectional geometry without gaps. With the variation of step-over distance, material efficiency alters accordingly for both solid and thin-walled structures. It is found that thin-walled structures are more sensitive to step-over distance in terms of material efficiency. The optimal step-over distance corresponding to the maximum material efficiency can be achieved for various geometries, allowing the optimization of the deposition parameters. Five case studies of complex models including solid and thin-walled structures are used to test the developed methodology. Experimental comparison between the proposed MAT-based path patterns and the traditional contour path patterns demonstrate significant improved performance in terms of gap-free cross-sections. The proposed path planning strategy is shown to be particularly beneficial for WAAM of thin-walled structures.},

  doi = {10.1117/12.2079957},
  abstract = {Selective laser melting is yet to become a standardized industrial manufacturing technique. The process continues to suffer from defects such as distortions, residual stresses, localized deformations and warpage caused primarily due to the localized heating, rapid cooling and high temperature gradients that occur during the process. While process monitoring and control of selective laser melting is an active area of research, establishing the reliability and robustness of the process still remains a challenge.
In this paper, a methodology for generating reliable, optimized scanning paths and process parameters for selective laser melting of a standard sample is introduced. The processing of the sample is simulated by sequentially coupling a calibrated 3D pseudo-analytical thermal model with a 3D finite element mechanical model.
The optimized processing parameters are subjected to a Monte Carlo method based uncertainty and reliability analysis. The reliability of the scanning paths are established using cumulative probability distribution functions for process output criteria such as sample density, thermal homogeneity, etc. A customized genetic algorithm is used along with the simulation model to generate optimized cellular scanning strategies and processing parameters, with an objective of reducing thermal asymmetries and mechanical deformations. The optimized scanning strategies are used for selective laser melting of the standard samples, and experimental and numerical results are compared.},

One of the main advantages of SLM is the large geometrical design freedom. Because of the layered build, parts with inner cavities can be produced.

The first part of this work describes the process parameter optimization for noncomplex, upfacing structures to obtain relative densities above 99\%. In the second part of this research, parameters are optimized for downfacing areas, both horizontal and inclined. The experimental results are compared to simulations of a thermal model, which calculates the melt pool dimensions based on the material properties (such as thermal conductivity) and process parameters (such as laser power and scan speed). The simulations show a great similarity between the thermal model and the actual process.},

The goal of this study is to develop a multi-objective approach to optimize the cellular scanning strategy such that the two aforementioned defects are minimized. The decision variable in the chosen problem is a combination of the sequence in which cells are processed and one of six scanning strategies applied to each cell. Thus, the problem is a combination of combinatorial and choice optimization, which makes the problem difficult to solve. On a process simulation domain consisting of 32 cells, our multi-objective evolutionary method is able to find a set of trade-off solutions for the defined conflicting objectives, which cannot be obtained by performing merely a local search. Possible similarities in Pareto-optimal solutions are explored.},

  abstract = {Repeatability and reproducibility of parts produced by selective laser melting is a standing issue, and coupled with a lack of standardized quality control presents a major hindrance towards maturing of selective laser melting as an industrial scale process. Consequently, numerical process modelling has been adopted towards improving the predictability of the outputs from the selective laser melting process. Establishing the reliability of the process, however, is still a challenge, especially in components having overhanging structures. 

 $<$/p$>$In this paper, a systematic approach towards establishing reliability of overhanging structure production by selective laser melting has been adopted. A calibrated, fast, multiscale thermal model is used to simulate the single track formation on a thick powder bed. Single tracks are manufactured on a thick powder bed using same processing parameters, but at different locations in a powder bed and in different laser scanning directions. The difference in melt track widths and depths captures the effect of changes in incident beam power distribution due to location and processing direction. The experimental results are used in combination with numerical model, and subjected to uncertainty and reliability analysis. Cumulative probability distribution functions obtained for melt track widths and depths are found to be coherent with observed experimental values. The technique is subsequently extended for reliability characterization of single layers produced on a thick powder bed without support structures, by determining cumulative probability distribution functions for average layer thickness, sample density and thermal homogeneity.},

In this paper, a combined modelling-experimental approach is introduced to establish the reliability of the selective laser melting process. A validated 3D finite-volume alternating-direction-implicit numerical technique is used to model the selective laser melting process, and is calibrated against results from single track formation experiments. Correlation coefficients are determined for process input parameters such as laser power, speed, beam profile, etc. Subsequently, uncertainties in the processing parameters are utilized to predict a range for the various outputs, using a Monte Carlo method based uncertainty analysis methodology, and the reliability of the process is established.},

Since many process variables affect AM, experimental measurements of residual stresses and distortion are time consuming and expensive. Numerical thermo-mechanical models can be used for their estimation, but the quality of calculations depends critically on the accurate transient temperature field which affects both the residual stresses and distortion. In this study, a well-tested, three-dimensional, transient heat transfer and fluid flow model is used to accurately calculate transient temperature field for the residual stress and distortion modeling. The calculated residual stress distributions are compared with independent experimental results. It is shown that the residual stresses can be significantly minimized by reducing the layer thickness during AM. Inconel 718 components are found to be more susceptible to delamination than Ti-6Al-4V parts because they encounter higher residual stresses compared to their yield strength.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D printing, is a direct digital manufacturing process, where a component can be produced layer by layer from 3D digital data with no or minimal use of machining, molding, or casting. AM has developed rapidly in the last 10 years and has demonstrated significant potential in cost reduction of performance-critical components. This can be realized through improved design freedom, reduced material waste, and reduced post processing steps. Modeling AM processes not only provides important insight in competing physical phenomena that lead to final material properties and product quality but also provides the means to exploit the design space towards functional products and materials. The length- and timescales required to model AM processes and to predict the final workpiece characteristics are very challenging. Models must span length scales resolving powder particle diameters, the build chamber dimensions, and several hundreds or thousands of meters of heat source trajectories. Depending on the scan speed, the heat source interaction time with feedstock can be as short as a few microseconds, whereas the build time can span several hours or days depending on the size of the workpiece and the AM process used. Models also have to deal with multiple physical aspects such as heat transfer and phase changes as well as the evolution of the material properties and residual stresses throughout the build time. The modeling task is therefore a multi-scale, multi-physics endeavor calling for a complex interaction of multiple algorithms. This paper discusses models required to span the scope of AM processes with a particular focus towards predicting as-built material characteristics and residual stresses of the final build. Verification and validation examples are presented, the over-spanning goal is to provide an overview of currently available modeling tools and how they can contribute to maturing additive manufacturing.},

To account for multiple obstacles, we avoid obstacles optimally one at a time. This is equivalent to following the pseudo-return function, which is an approximation of the true return function for the multi-obstacle problem. Paths generated by this method are near-optimal and guaranteed to reach the goal, at which the pseudo-return function is shown to have a unique minimum.
